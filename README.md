# Python Analytics Quest: Escape Room Game

## Overview
Welcome to the Python Analytics Quest! Your mission: code a text-based game, "Escape Room", utilizing Python skills learned in the bootcamp. By doing this, you’ll reinforce Python theory, enhance teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Ready? Let’s go!

## Setup

#### Research Key Topics:
- Learn how to read Python error messages, function documentation, and reinforce understanding of Python data structures and flow control.
- Learn about Python modules and packages, structuring code.
- Learn about good coding practices, including clean, readable code, and proper documentation.
- Review list and dictionary comprehensions, read about Python testing.

#### Development:
- Create dictionaries and lists serving as game data structures.
- Define functions and introduce flow control logic.
- Refine functions and flow control, adding interactivity.


## Quest Brief
Your team will develop the “Escape Room” game. Implement Python code, manage errors, and test your game to ensure robustness. Each room presents unique challenges. The goal is to escape from the starting room (Game Room) to the end (Outside). 

### Room Layout
*(Insert your room layout image here)*

### Game Narrative
Suddenly, you find yourself waking up on an unfamiliar couch, in an eerie house devoid of windows. Your memory fails to provide any explanation about how you ended up here, or what transpired previously. You can sense an imminent threat lurking somewhere - your gut tells you to escape the house immediately!

*(Continue the narrative as provided, including different rooms and their respective challenges)*

## Team Collaboration
For this project, we’re using Google Colab for collaborative work. It’s user-friendly, perfect for team projects, and lets you focus on Python concepts. As you progress through the bootcamp, you’ll transition to Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub, which are standard in the industry.

### Some Google Colab Tips:
- **Communication**: Keep your team informed about changes.
- **Working on the Same Cell**: Avoid simultaneous cell editing.
- **Saving Your Work**: Save your work manually frequently.
- **Refreshing**: Refresh your browser if changes aren’t showing.
- **Version History**: Access through File > Revision history.
- **Sharing**: Click Share to give teammates access.

## Deliverables

### The Game
Deliver a `main.ipynb` file with your Python game solution and the `.py` file(s) containing your functions. It should reflect the Python concepts learned each day and be pushed to GitHub. The end product should be fully functional but also well-structured, efficient, robust, and entertaining!

### Checklist of Deliverables:
- The game incorporates various data structures, specifically dictionaries and lists, to define game rooms, paths, and items.
- The game uses a Python dictionary to store the game state which is updated when progress is made, such as a key being collected.
- Flow control (`if`, `elif`, `else` statements) has been utilized to create game logic.
- The code appropriately uses loops where needed.
- The game uses functions to compartmentalize tasks such as navigating between rooms or interacting with items.
- Arguments are used in functions where appropriate to allow for reusability.
- The game uses return statements in functions to output certain results.
- After completing each game action, functions are called to continue playing until the winning condition is reached.
- The game utilizes comprehension for creating more efficient and readable code where applicable.
- Any user input is validated and the game incorporates error handling techniques to handle any possible errors or exceptions.
- The code is well-documented with comments explaining different sections of the code.
- The game has a clear end goal or “win” condition that the player can achieve (making it “Outside”).

### Additional Game Features (Optional)
If you want to go above and beyond the basics, here are some ideas of improvements for your project:

- Apply proper error handling using `try-except-finally` blocks.
- Use *args and **kwargs in functions for enhanced flexibility.
- Implement the use of `zip` to iterate over two or more iterables simultaneously.
- Incorporate regex patterns to validate user input.
- Apply OOP principles by refactoring the code into classes.
